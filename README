These two scripts demonstrate a DOS attack against a server running SSL and
eventlet.

simple_eventlet_ssl.py starts a simple wsgi server. slow_conn.py is a client
that reads one byte every two seconds.

Start simple_eventlet_ssl.py and then run slow_conn.py. Note that if you start
a second instance of slow_conn.py, the second (and all subsequent) instance
will not read any data until the first connection is finished or terminated.

The interesting thing is that it only happens (on my machine) with a response
body that is 668706 bytes or larger.
